# Team Profile Generator Setup

Create Employees from classes

I get the inputs from the cli... when to create a class?

- as soon as the data is received

Where?

  - have a createEmployee function that accepts data
  - this imports the employees classes
  - gets the input data
  - writes to a json file


DONE
-- need tests
-- class based code
-- generate html
-- inquirer prompt

Create HTML shell file with styles and then pull strings from that


/roletypes intern, engineer, none


0 && none == mgr

Is there a case where I don't know role type?
like i go through, fill out the form, then don't want anymore 
- does this last one get created?
